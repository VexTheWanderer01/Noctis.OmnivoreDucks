<p>Omnivore Animals. Thats it.</p>
<p><b>FAQ</b>:</p>
<p>Compatible with other mods altering these animals?</p>
<p><i>Yes. Its a simple patch.</i></p>
<p>CE?</p>
<p><i>Probably. Don't use it.</i></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><i>Ducks and Chickens are omnivores irl and eat fish and worms and such. Squirrels will cannibalize other squirrels and also eat insects and baby birds/other sources of meat. Wouldn't make sense to make them herbivores even facultative because they need meat to live.</i></p>
<p>License?</p>
<p><i>Unilicense. Do whatever you want with it, I don't care.</i></p>
